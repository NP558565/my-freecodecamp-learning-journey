/*We can also delete properties from objects like this:

```javascript
delete ourDog.bark;
```
Delete the `"tails"` property from `myDog`. You may use either dot or 
bracket notation.*/

// Example
var ourDog = {
  name: "Camper",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["everything!"],
  bark: "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;

// Setup
var myDog = {
  name: "Happy Coder",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
  bark: "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line.
delete myDog.tails;
