/*Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are _mutable_ and can be changed freely.
Example
```javascript
var ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```
Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, 
like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, 
this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Modify the data stored at index `0` of `myArray` to a value of `45`s.*/

// Example
var ourArray = [18, 64, 99];
ourArray[1] = 45; // ourArray now equals [18,45,99].

// Setup
var myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line.

myArray[0] = 45;
